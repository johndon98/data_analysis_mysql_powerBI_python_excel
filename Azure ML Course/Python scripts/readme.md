## Azure Machine Learning Exercises - MSLEARN DP-100

The code was cloned from https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-dp100

* I used the notebooks to practice and learn the different techniques in Azure ML.
* I then uploaded the notebooks containing the experiments and runs executed from my own Azure ML workspace.
